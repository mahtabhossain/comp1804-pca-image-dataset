Application of PCA on two different image dataset.

There are two notebooks:

pca_logistic_regression_cifar10.ipynb:
--------------------------------------
In this notebook, we apply a supervised ML algorithm that we covered before (Logistic Regression) and then also apply PCA to compare performance with/without PCA using the same algorithm.

pca_logistic_regression_courswork_image_sample.ipynb:
-----------------------------------------------------
This notebook is exactly the same as the other one - the only difference is, it uses a sample of your coursework dataset [where the labels are randomly generated]. This is just for demonstration to show a ML workflow for a coursework dataset sample.

*All the input and output files are under the 'data' folder. 
*Inside each notebook, we provide a summarised explanation of the overall workflow of it in the beginning, and list a set of reflections in the end.
